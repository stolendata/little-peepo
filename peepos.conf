#
# accounts can be configured to authenticate either with APOP (encrypted
# authentication) or with USER/PASS (plain-text), but not both.
# accounts that are set-up for APOP must somewhat ironically store their
# passwords in plain-text and prefix them with "apop:", and accounts
# set-up for USER/PASS must store them as base64-encoded hashes prefixed
# with "pass:".
#
# the hashed content for USER/PASS authentication is the account name
# followed by the password. the product can be generated using openssl:
#
#   if the account name is "Largo" and the password is "LaGrand3" then...
#
#   echo -n 'LargoLaGrand3' | openssl dgst -binary -sha256 | openssl base64
#
#   ...should produce "8le7YiymHu5/cSWOP4l687kNFy+J1BdshX8H1JN9Ci8="
