#
# an account can be configured to authenticate either with APOP (encrypted
# authentication) or with USER/PASS (plain-text), but not both.
# accounts that are set-up for APOP must somewhat ironically store their
# passwords in plain-text, prefixed with "apop:". accounts set-up to use
# USER/PASS must store them as base64-encoded SHA256 hashes, and prefix
# them with "pass:". the recommended scheme is USER/PASS in order to help
# protect the account file, since little peepo already enforces TLS.
#
# the hashed content for USER/PASS authentication is the account login
# followed by the password. the product can be generated using openssl:
#
#   if the account login is "Largo" and the password is "LaGrand3" then...
#
#   echo -n 'LargoLaGrand3' | openssl dgst -binary -sha256 | openssl base64
#
#   ...should produce "8le7YiymHu5/cSWOP4l687kNFy+J1BdshX8H1JN9Ci8="
#
# note: passwords and logins are case-sensitive, and little peepo enforces
#       a minimum password length of 20 characters. the use of memorable
#       passphrases is discouraged.
